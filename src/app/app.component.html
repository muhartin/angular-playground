        Francis Ford Coppola's legendary continuation and sequel to his landmark
        1972 film, The_Godfather parallels the young Vito Corleone's rise with
        his son Michael's spiritual fall, deepening The_Godfather's depiction of
        the dark side of the American dream. In the early 1900s, the child Vito
        flees his Sicilian village for America after the local Mafia kills his
        family. Vito struggles to make a living, legally or illegally, for his
        wife and growing brood in Little Italy, killing the local Black Hand
        Fanucci after he demands his customary cut of the tyro's business. With
        Fanucci gone, Vito's communal stature grows.
